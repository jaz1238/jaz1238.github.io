# About Me

Hi! My name is Jasbir (or Jas). I'm a university student at SIT, specializing in FinTech. My journey began in Finance, but my curiousity led me to explore the intersection of technology and business. I have recently interned at AIA Singapore, focusing on digital transformation and generative AI.

## What I Love to Do

*Besides exploring innovative technologies, I enjoy a good book to unwind after a long day and a good hike for exercise.*
