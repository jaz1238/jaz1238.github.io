## Reflection on the Use of GenAI

For this project, GenAI has been a valuable assistant in building my website. It helped me structure my content and refine the layout of the pages. From suggesting ways to structure my pages to teaching me how to format my text and lastly assisting me with creating a pretty styles.css, GenAI saved me time and effort.

The tools also guided me in embedding multimedia elements like images and videos, ensuring my website was both informative and visually appealing. While the AI provided great suggestions, I ensured that the final content reflected my voice and purpose for the site.

Using GenAI in this project has shown me how technology can simplify complex tasks, allowing me to focus on creativity and personalisation. It’s been a great learning experience.
